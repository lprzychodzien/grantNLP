# grantNLP
What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).
How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?
What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?
How will you present your work?
Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?
Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?
What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
What is the next thing you need to work on?
Getting the data, not just some, likely all?
Understanding the data?
Building a minimum viable product?
Gauging how much signal might be in the data?
