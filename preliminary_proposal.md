# Preliminary Proposal

## High level description of project.
I will use the grant list available through the US government and web scrape to obtain their abstracts. Then I will use NLP to identfy major topics in the abstracts pulled.  

## What question or problem are you trying to solve?
What awarded grant trends exist and which topics are expected to see an increase in awarded grant money over time. This can allow current grant writers topics on which to focus on and thus improve their success rate of acceptance. Ideally this can also help visualize and predict major trends in research. 

## How will you present your work?
Results will be presented as a slide deck presentation with visualizations that highlight the topics identified over time. Furthermore, the key words of the most popular grant topics and expected trending topics will also be presented. 

## What are your data sources?
The US Human Resource and Services Administration has awarded grant data available through their portal: https://data.hrsa.gov/hdw/tools/dataportal.aspx. Abstracts will be obtained from scraping the grant's respected links. 

## Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project.
The next step is to download the grant data, obtain the abstracts, clean the data, and finally perform the NLP. 

## Probably getting the data.
The awarded grant data is available and is not an issue. The only potential issue is the abstracts being either unavailable or incomplete.
